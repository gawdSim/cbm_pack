# cbm_pack
This library aims to provide a central hub for various analysis
scripts used within the Mauk Lab at the University of Texas at
Austin. The hope in developing this package are threefold:

1) To provide a central resource for any type of data manipulation
   necessary for data produced by [cbm_sim](https://github.com/gawdSim/CbmSim).
2) To cater to future analyses within the lab
3) To be easy to install and use

# Installation

```bash
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/gawdSim/cbm_pack.git'
```
This will automatically install dependencies (numpy and scipy) into the
current environment. If you have not activated a virtual environment, then
all libraries will be installed globally, so be careful!
